# pony-quant: HF → EXL3 converter — engineering roadmap (handoff)

Updated 2026-06-18. Status: **M1 complete, M2 complete, M3b direct full-layer
emit/load gate complete, M4b oracle-proxy LDLQ comparator complete**
(`tests/test_convert.py`, `tests/test_convert_metal.py`,
`tests/test_convert_hessian.py`).

Goal: accept a HuggingFace checkpoint (safetensors), emit an EXL3 checkpoint
that `ponyexl3/mlx/model.py` loads unmodified, with per-layer bit
calibration under a global bpw budget. Reference implementation throughout
the exllamav3 source tree (https://github.com/turboderp-org/exllamav3),
`exllamav3/` —
`conversion/{convert_model,measure_model,optimize_model,allocation,
calibration_data,compile}.py`, `modules/quant/exl3_lib/quantize.py` (1151
lines, the math core), `exllamav3_ext/quant/quantize.cu` (the search kernel).

Current checkpoint-backed pilot:

- Source BF16 model:
  `/Users/beam/llm/models/Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B`
- Oracle EXL3 model:
  `/Users/beam/llm/models/Exl3/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-exl3-4.00bpw`
- Fast module/tile:
  `model.language_model.layers.0.linear_attn.in_proj_qkv`, tile `[0, 0]`
- Secondary MoE gate pilot:
  `model.language_model.layers.0.mlp.experts.0.gate_proj`; current oracle
  block has zero `svh` scales, so this remains an expected rejected fixture
  until output-space validation replaces raw block inversion for routed paths.
- Latest Metal pilot result on the fast tile:
  converted target MSE `4.659796e-03`, oracle target MSE `8.931810e-03`,
  converted rel-RMS `0.065796`, oracle rel-RMS `0.091093`, pack round-trip
  `True`.
- Latest M3 direct-window result on the fast 128×128 block:
  public rel-RMS `0.067390`, output rel-RMS `0.070094`, inner MSE
  `5.283837e-03`, public MSE `1.360480e-06`, output MSE `1.704962e-04`,
  mini bundle reloads through `load_exl3_layer`.
- Latest M3 direct full-layer result on `in_proj_qkv`:
  shape `(2048, 8192)`, trellis `(128, 512, 64)`, output rel-RMS
  `0.069103`, public rel-RMS `0.069056`, inner MSE `5.498035e-03`, output
  MSE `2.255773e-03`; `oracle_safe` scale mode replaced `112` zero `svh`
  entries with `1.0`; full local run took `147 s`, so normal pytest uses a
  synthetic full-layer gate.

## Ground truths already nailed (do NOT re-derive; gates exist)

1. **Window/codeword convention**: codeword t of a tile is the full 16-bit
   window of the tail-biting 256K-bit stream ending at bit (t+1)K. Fresh
   bits per step are the **LOW K bits** of each window; the transition is
   `s' = ((s << K) | fresh) & 0xFFFF`. Verified 256/256 against a real
   checkpoint tile including the wrap (Phase 26).
2. **Packing**: use `ponyexl3/ref/trellis.py::pack_trellis(_tile)` with
   input `states & ((1<<K)-1)`. `ref_pack(low_k(unpack(tile))) == tile`
   bit-exactly on real checkpoints. Never write another packer.
3. **Decode parity**: all reconstruction must go through
   `ref/codebook.py::decode_3inst` (numpy) or `mlx/gemv_metal.py::
   _decode_expr` (Metal) — these are bit-matched to CUDA (lop3 convention
   `(a<<2)|(b<<1)|c`, half-add `__hadd` parity; see Phases 1-3 history).
4. **Lesson (it cost real time)**: a hand-rolled packer and a "corrected"
   search transition formed a self-consistent WRONG pair that round-tripped
   against each other. Real checkpoints are the only arbiter for format
   conventions.

## What exists now (M1 + M2 + M3b + M4b)

- `convert/reference_search.py` — exact numpy Viterbi, any K∈[1,8], any
  codebook mode; tail-biting via pinned re-passes; ~0.5-2 s/tile. This is
  the **parity oracle** for the Metal kernel, not a production path.
  Quality: MSE 0.075/0.021/0.005/0.0003 at K=2/3/4/6 on unit Gaussians
  (QTIP-class).
- `convert/fixtures.py` — lightweight checkpoint-backed conversion fixture:
  BF16 safetensors slice reader, Qwen dense/MoE source adapters, oracle EXL3
  loading, source→EXL3 inner-block inversion, and one 16×16 tile comparison.
  Data types are in place for `SourceLinear`, `OracleLinear`,
  `QuantizedLinearTensors`, `LayerFixture`, and `TilePilotResult`.
- `convert/metal_search.py` — MLX/Metal trellis search for kernel-order
  16×16 tiles, one tile per threadgroup, K∈[2,8], all three codebooks.
  It mirrors CUDA's compressed-edge DP shape and roll-128 warmup + pinned
  tail-biting pass, then returns full 16-bit states plus reconstructed tiles.
  K≥4 keeps costs in threadgroup memory; K=2/3 uses device cost scratch.
  Batches are split by `max_scratch_bytes` to bound backpointer/cost scratch.
- `cli/convert.py` / `ponyexl3-convert` — current CLI is the oracle-comparable
  one-tile pilot by default. It accepts `--search-backend cpu|metal`; CPU
  remains the stable default. `--direct-window` runs the M3 direct 128×128
  block quantizer and writes a minimal loadable EXL3 bundle when `--out-dir`
  is provided. `--direct-layer` quantizes the whole selected linear module;
  `--ldlq-layer` runs the M4a Hessian/LDLQ one-linear pilot. `--scale-mode
  oracle_safe` keeps oracle scales but replaces zero entries with `1.0`.
- `convert/direct.py` — no-LDL direct conversion for one 128×128 Hadamard
  block and for a full linear module: source BF16 public blocks → scaled inner
  blocks → M2 tile quantization → `EXL3Layer` → optional safetensors bundle +
  `quantization_config.json`/`model.safetensors.index.json` reload gate.
  Identity/no-scale mode now leaves public weights in the public basis instead
  of applying unused Hadamards; Qwen oracle-scale paths are unchanged.
- `convert/hessian.py` — M4b Hessian/LDLQ primitives: activation Hessian
  capture, upstream-style diagonal damping, NumPy/Accelerate block-LDL,
  reverse 16-row LDLQ over inner-domain weights, Hessian proxy metrics, and a
  fixture-backed one-linear `ldlq_quantize_layer` path that emits the same
  minimal loadable bundle as direct conversion. M4b adds
  `public_matrix_to_inner` and oracle comparison weights, so the same Hessian
  reports converted-vs-source, oracle-vs-source, and converted/oracle proxy
  and output ratios.
- `tests/test_convert.py` — transition invariant + bit round-trip +
  MSE bounds, k∈{2,3}, BF16 reader gate, Qwen source adapter gate, CPU
  one-tile oracle gate, guarded Metal one-tile oracle gate, and expected
  zero-scale rejection for the MoE gate block.
- `tests/test_convert_metal.py` — Metal-only gates: random-tile quality
  within `1.10×` CPU reference for K∈{2,3,4}, all codebooks at K=4, exact
  recovery of ideal tail-biting tiles for K∈{2,3,4,5,8}, pack/unpack
  round-trip, forced chunked-batch scratch coverage, and explicit K=1
  rejection.
- `tests/test_convert_hessian.py` — M4b gates: Hessian capture/regularize +
  block-LDL identity-block checks, identity-Hessian LDLQ equals direct
  quantization exactly, correlated-Hessian proxy stats stay bounded against
  direct quantization, public→inner identity mode is a no-op, and a guarded
  Metal synthetic 128×128 LDLQ layer emits/reloads while beating its synthetic
  oracle on Hessian proxy and output ratios.
- Verification as of 2026-06-18:
  `python -m pytest tests/test_convert.py tests/test_convert_metal.py
  tests/test_convert_hessian.py -q` → 26 passed; `python -m pyright
  ponyexl3/convert ponyexl3/cli/convert.py tests/test_convert.py
  tests/test_convert_metal.py tests/test_convert_hessian.py` → clean.

## M2 — Metal trellis-search kernel

Status: **functionally complete**. The working primitive is
`quantize_tiles_mlx(_np)` in `convert/metal_search.py`.

Implemented:

- One 16×16 tile per threadgroup through `mx.fast.metal_kernel`.
- K∈[2,8]: K≥4 uses threadgroup-resident `half costs[2][edges]`; K=2/3
  uses device cost scratch because Apple threadgroup memory caps at 32 KB.
- Inline decode for DEFAULT/MCG/MUL1 using the existing codebook formulas.
- Backpointers in device scratch (`temp_edges`) and in-kernel backtracking.
- CUDA-style `roll=128` warmup, then `roll=0` pinned tail-biting solve.
- Returns reconstructed tiles plus full 16-bit states; existing
  `pack_trellis_tile(states & ((1<<K)-1), K)` remains the only pack path.
- Batch chunking via `max_scratch_bytes`, so large tile batches are split
  instead of allocating unbounded `temp_edges` scratch.

M2 notes:

- Decide the CUDA parity contract: bit-identical indices where no ties occur,
  otherwise equal-MSE/tail-biting/pack-roundtrip. Current tests gate quality
  rather than exact random-tile state identity because CPU and Metal use
  different precision/tie behavior.
- Keep optional A/B of a 128 KB device LUT of all 65536 decoded values vs
  inline ALU decode for throughput only; correctness already comes from the
  inline path.
- Measured K=4 MCG random-tile throughput on this machine: about
  `1.2 Mtiles/min` after warm compile at the default 256 MB scratch cap
  (`2048` tiles in `0.102 s`). The old `2 Mtiles/min` note remains an
  aspirational optimization target, not a correctness blocker. A 1024-thread
  per-tile variant was tested and was slower on M5 Max; the 256-thread shape
  has better occupancy.

Original kernel constraints still apply:

- Threadgroup ≤1024 threads (CUDA uses `MIN(1024, 65536>>K)`); cost arrays
  `temp_costs[2][edges]`, edges = 65536>>K. In this Metal version, K≥4 stays
  in threadgroup memory; K=2/3 uses device scratch; K=1 is unsupported.
- Per step t∈[0,256): for each out-edge group, min over 2^K incoming
  branches; branch cost `(decode_3inst(state) − w[t])²` in **half** (CUDA
  uses half costs + `H_INF` sentinels — keep; it's part of parity).
  Decode via the existing `_decode_expr` template ⇒ bit parity by
  construction. Optional A/B: a 128 KB device LUT of all 65536 decoded
  values (Apple SLC-friendly) vs inline ALU decode.
- Backpointers: `temp_edges` (256 × edges × u16 = 2 MB/tile at K=4) in a
  device scratch buffer; batch tiles per launch to bound scratch (512
  tiles → 1 GB; tune).
- Tail-biting: mirror CUDA's `roll`/`pre_state` two-pass pinning (the
  `forward` lambda, quantize.cu:57+). `reference_search.py` implements the
  same scheme — diff against it.
- Backtrack: CUDA does it in-kernel; the Metal port now does the same.
- **Gates**: (a) random-tile reconstruction MSE ≤ `1.10×` CPU reference for
  K∈{2,3,4}; (b) exact recovery on ideal tail-biting tiles; (c) pack→unpack
  round-trip; (d) forced chunked-batch scratch path; (e) one checkpoint-backed
  Qwen tile through the oracle fixture.
- **Metal pitfalls already hit in this repo**: `//` comments inside
  multi-line `#define`s get line-spliced (strip via `decode_bs`);
  register cliffs near 32 simdgroup accumulators; `_decode_expr` declares
  `dq_val` in-scope (wrap call sites in braces).

## M3 — Regularize + direct one-linear conversion

Status: **M3b complete for direct no-LDL full-layer conversion**. The current
direct path does not yet regularize or choose scales from scratch; it can use
identity scales for synthetic tests or `oracle_safe` scales for the Qwen pilot.
`oracle_safe` borrows oracle `suh`/`svh` but replaces zero scale entries with
`1.0`, because real `in_proj_qkv` oracle metadata contains non-source-zero
output channels with zero `svh`.

Remaining direct-path work should stay on the same lightweight pilot before
expanding:

1. Port upstream `regularize`, `block_rms`, Hadamard transforms, MCG/default
   codebook flags, and global scale GSS. Gate with one converted EXL3 layer
   loaded through the existing `EXL3Layer`/`EXL3Linear`.
2. Replace `oracle_safe` with freshly computed `suh`/`svh` from regularize
   and compare against the current oracle-safe baseline.

## M4 — Hessian/LDLQ, driver + emit

Status: **M4b complete**. The current implemented slice is converter-local and
fixture-backed, not yet a layer-sequential model driver:

- `capture_hessian`: `X.T @ X` accumulation with optional normalization.
- `prepare_hessian_for_ldl`: dead-channel handling and `sigma_reg` diagonal
  damping.
- `block_ldl`: NumPy Cholesky with the upstream retry ladder; diagonal 16×16
  blocks are normalized to identity.
- `ldlq_inner_matrix`: reverse 16-row LDLQ with tensor-core tile order handled
  by the M2 quantizer and packed with the existing trellis packer only.
- `ldlq_quantize_layer`: one full selected linear module through
  source→inner assembly, fixture activation Hessian, LDLQ, `EXL3Layer`, output
  metrics, and optional minimal bundle reload through the existing writer.
- `oracle_comparison_weights`: dequantize the oracle layer, transform it back
  into the same comparable inner basis as the source/converted layer, and
  report oracle proxy/output error plus converted/oracle ratios.
- CLI: `--ldlq-layer`, `--sigma-reg`, and `--buf-size-rows`.

Next M4 steps:

1. Run `--ldlq-layer` on the Qwen `in_proj_qkv` pilot with Metal and compare
   output/proxy error against the direct `oracle_safe` baseline.
2. Port regularized/GSS scale selection so LDLQ no longer depends on oracle
   scale metadata.
3. Promote the one-linear path into a layer-0 driver that quantizes all
   quantizable linears sharing each input Hessian group.

- `hessian.py`: layer-sequential driver. Load the HF model with mlx_lm's
  classes (qwen3_5/qwen3_5_moe already mapped); stream calibration rows
  (reuse `exllamav3/conversion/standard_cal_data/*` and the sampling in
  `calibration_data.py`) through embedding → block i, accumulating
  per-linear-INPUT `H += xᵀx` in fp32 on device (H is (in,in):
  2048²=16 MB, 5120²=105 MB — fine). Same-input siblings (q/k/v/z;
  gate/up; ALL experts' gate/up share the block input) share one H —
  exllamav3's capture dict keys by input; mirror it.
- After quantizing block i, RE-FORWARD its output from the quantized
  weights before capturing block i+1 (GPTQ error propagation) —
  `convert_model.py`'s main loop is the ordering reference.
- `regularize` port (quantize.py:835): seeded random sign flips (su/sv),
  128-block Hadamard, JSD accept heuristic. fp32.
- `block_ldl` port (quantize.py:292): Cholesky on H with the `sigma_reg`
  damping retry ladder. numpy/CPU is fine — microseconds per layer.
- `ldlq` port (quantize.py:365): per 16-row block in kernel order
  (`ref/perm.py` has tensor_core_perm), quantize tiles via M2 with
  error feedback through L, two passes like upstream (call site
  quantize.py:1065). Port `g_scale_gss` (golden-section global scale)
  and `block_rms` faithfully — they shape final quality.
- **Gate**: quantize ONE Qwen3.5-2B layer; proxy error
  tr(EHEᵀ)/tr(WHWᵀ) within ~10% of the corresponding layer in the
  upstream-made 4.00bpw checkpoint (dequantize theirs and recompute).

- Walk blocks in order; MoE experts are independent Linears — emit
  per-expert tensors exactly like upstream (the stacked layout is an
  inference-side load-time transform).
- Emit safetensors shards `{name}.{trellis,suh,svh,mcg,mul1,bias}` +
  `config.json`/`quantization_config` + tokenizer files. Confirm exact
  tensor names by `safe_open` on an existing checkpoint; our `load_model`
  (strict) IS the format spec — loading with it is the gate.
- **Resume/checkpointing**: hours-overnight jobs; persist per-module
  outputs + a manifest so a crash resumes at the next module (upstream's
  `compile.py` + job-dir scheme is the model).
- **Gates**: full Qwen3.5-2B convert @4.0 bpw → loads strict; teacher-
  forced quality within the class of the existing 2B-exl3-4.00bpw;
  generation sanity; suite stays green.

## M5 — per-layer bit calibration (~2-3 days)

Port both upstream tiers, in this order:
- **M5a priority allocation** (`conversion/allocation.py::
  create_q_strategy`): integer base K = floor(bpw); spend the remaining
  budget one bit at a time by module-group priority (qgroups,
  `q_priority`). Cheap, no extra compute — produces "4.15bpw"-style
  mixes. CLI: `--bpw`, `--head-bits`.
- **M5b measured allocation** (`measure_model.py` + `optimize_model.py`):
  quantize a sample of each module at candidate K, record proxy error,
  optimize the allocation under the budget — the full "calibrate bits per
  layer". Mitigate the K-candidate multiplier by measuring on row subsets
  like upstream. CLI: `--hq`, `--layer-bits regex:K` overrides.

## M6 — polish

Tile batching across MoE experts per launch; progress UI; `--dry-run`
size report; `fallback_quant` port (quantize.py:484 — no-LDL variant for
degenerate H / odd layers); MCG/MUL1 codebook flags (DEFAULT suffices for
new conversions); README for converted models (recommend the Phase-26
runtime env, e.g. EXL3_WCACHE default).

## Runtime expectations (M5 Max, post-M2 target)

| model | search | total (1 pass, incl. Hessian+LDLQ) |
|---|---|---|
| 2B | ~4 min | ~1-2 h |
| 27B | ~50 min | overnight |
| 35B-A3B | ~1 h (experts are small tiles) | overnight |

## Open questions for the implementer

- Chase bit-identical encodings vs CUDA argmin tie-order, or accept
  equal-MSE? (Recommend equal-MSE; document the tie-break.)
- fp16 cost overflow at large K — CUDA clamps via H_INF; watch for
  inf-poisoning interacting with pinned passes.
- mx.linalg Cholesky stability — numpy fallback is free.
